### User Stories
Welcome to X. This site focuses on the internal communication that happens between condo associations.
The user will come to the site to register their information as well as provide their building's address. Once registration is complete they will then be directed to that building's unique forum where they can submit posts to their neighbors. The forum will be used to allow neighbors to keep in contact, alert one another in case there is a security issue, post party / association meetings as well as day-to-day items and questions via message boards.
